Ownership and Contributions

All contributions to the "ITG Simulator" are subject to approval by the supreme overseer, "neonicpretty" (henceforth referred to as The Decider).
License Grant

You are granted the license to download, install, and run "ITG Simulator" on your device provided you agree to not touch, alter, or look at the code sideways without express written consent issued via a cryptic message on Discord by The Decider.
Prohibited Acts

Modifying, translating, reverse-engineering, or otherwise deciphering the code without a treasure map that leads to The Decider's secret lair (coordinates available upon request, terms and conditions apply).
Using the code for any purpose that hasn't been foretold by the ancient prophecies (or recent Discord posts by The Decider).
No Warranty

This program is provided 'as is' without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. Seriously, if something breaks, we're just going to blame gremlins or something.
Limitation of Liability

In no event shall The Decider, or any other contributor, be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use "ITG Simulator" (including but not limited to the loss of virtual pets within the simulator).
Termination

This license is effective until terminated by The Decider, who may do so if you fail to comply with any term or condition, or just because it's a Tuesday and why not?
Miscellaneous

If any part of this License is held to be unenforceable, the enforceability of the remaining parts shall not be affected. Except the parts about not modifying the code; those are super enforceable, in a non-legal but very stern-looking manner.
By downloading, copying, installing, or using the "ITG Simulator," you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this Moccup Satiere License. If you do not agree to the terms of this license, please delete all copies of "ITG Simulator" immediately. Or don't, we're a license, not a cop.
